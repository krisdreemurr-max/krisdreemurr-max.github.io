# Code-CTeam-2024
Coding notebook, to document what we have been doing!

## General Format
There is a markdown file for each problem/solution we are documenting. Include the following in each problem/solution:
 - Title
 - Date/time range it was worked on
 - Solution(s)
 - Any relevant code for that solution
## Useful Tips
 - To format code in a cool way, use three backticks (```) at the start and finish, like this:
 ```
 Scanner scan = new Scanner(system.in);
 System.out.println("Like this!");
 ```
 - You can also indent text to put it in a code block.
 - To create a markdown file, include a .md at the end of the file name.
 - [This extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) is a good way to preview markdown.
