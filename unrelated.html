    <h1>Unrelated, an Undertale/Deltarune project</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>This is a project I intend to do, through using Java and minecraft, I want to create a minecraft mod in which I will try my best to represent the Undertale and Deltarune world. This is a <strong>big Work In Progress</strong>, please check back later to see if I have made any progress, you can also follow this progress on GitHub (when I actually start building it.)</p>
    <p>It will be available on Curseforge in a ridiculously rudimentary beta phase in January/February</p>
    <p>Documentary will become available soon.</p>
